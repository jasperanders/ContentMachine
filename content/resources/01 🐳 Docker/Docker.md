# Why use Docker?

Docker is a [[DevOps#Software Containerization|software containerization tool]] that is free and open source. If you want to run docker locally on your machine, you practically always want to use docker. Besides the ability to `build` and `run` containers, docker also provides a large [[Containerization Terminology#Registry]] called Docker Hub.

When people talk about Docker, they mostly talk about _Docker Engine_, a product of the company called Docker. The company itself has other products, not all of them are free to use and open source.

# Alternatives to Docker

Because of standardization efforts, Docker is compatible with other containerization software.
