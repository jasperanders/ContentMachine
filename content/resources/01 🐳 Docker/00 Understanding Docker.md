# Understanding Docker

## Why use Docker?

Docker is a [[01 Understanding DevOps#Software Containerization|software containerization tool]], that is free and open source. If you want to run or build containers locally or in a pipeline on your machine, you practically always want to use docker. Besides the ability to `build` and `run` containers, docker also provides a large [[01 Containerization Terminology#Container Registry|Registry]] called Docker Hub. You might notice, that the only place you will find docker in this project is in the pipeline. You might wonder why we don't need docker on the server or in our cluster. The reason is that, container images have been standardized. Any container runtime can run any container (as long as they follow the standard). The main takeaway here is, you can continue using docker locally or in the pipeline, even if you don't use it in production.

Side note: When people talk about Docker, they mostly talk about _Docker Engine_, a product of the company called Docker. The company itself has other products, not all of them are free to use and open source. One example is Docker Desktop (not available for Linux), which is supposed to be very handy and even can provide a local Kubernetes cluster.

## Alternatives to Docker

Because of standardization efforts, Docker images are compatible with other containerization software.
