# Setting Up a GitLab CI Pipeline

If you don't know what a pipeline is supposed to do, check out [[01 Understanding DevOps#CI Pipeline|this]]. In the [[00 Motivation|Motivation Section]] we laid out some tasks we want our pipeline to perform. The stages of our pipeline will be the following:

1. **Build Stage:** We will build the docker image defined in our `Dockerfile` and push it to the [[02 GitLab Container Registry Integration|GitLab Registry]]. 
2. **Release Stage:** We tag the image build in stage 1 with `:latest`. In theory, this step is not necessary, we could have just tagged the image in the previous step. If we had a staging server, we could tag a staging image here.
3. **Deploy Stage:** All actions in the deployment stage, must be triggered manually. We allow for multiple actions in the Deploy Stage.: 
	- Deploy the `:latest` image, to the connected Kubernetes cluster. 
	- Reset the Postgres database using the oTree command `otree resetdb`.
	- Remove the whole project (i.e. all its resources) from the Kubernetes cluster.

GitLab CI Pipeline is defined in the `gitlab-ci.yaml`. As soon as such a file is present in the GitLab repository, the pipeline can be viewed under _CI/CD > Pipelines_.  To run a pipeline, you need to have at [[01 Connecting a GitLab Runner|GitLab Runner]] installed. Make sure to only use runners running in your cluster, otherwise the pipeline won't run.

## Dissecting the Pipeline

Next, we will take a closer look at the pipeline. You will notice, that we use some env variables. Most of them are available by default, we still have to add `MASTER_PWD` and set a password. This will be later used to access the database and the admin panel.

![Add Environment Variables](./attachments/EnvironmentVariables.png)

See comments below, to understand what the commands do.

```YAML

stages:
  - build
  # if you want a test stage add it here
  - release
  - deploy

variables:
  # Define variables for image tagging
  CONTAINER_TEST_IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
  CONTAINER_RELEASE_IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest
  # This instructs Docker not to start over TLS.
  DOCKER_HOST: tcp://localhost:2375
  DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""

build:
  stage: build
  # uncomment next line for manual build stage
  # when: manual
  # it is required to use a specific docker version
  image: docker:19.03.12
  services:
  # to build docker images in a docker container you need to run
  # dind (docker in docker) 
    - docker:19.03.12-dind
  script:
    # login to gitlab registry
    - echo $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD | docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER $CI_REGISTRY --password-stdin
    # build container
    - docker build -t $CONTAINER_TEST_IMAGE .
    # push container to gitlab registry
    - docker push $CONTAINER_TEST_IMAGE

release:
  image: docker:19.03.12
  services:
    - docker:19.03.12-dind
  stage: release
  needs: ["build"]
  script:
    # login to gitlab registry
    - echo $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD | docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER $CI_REGISTRY --password-stdin
    # pull, add tag to img and push to registry again
    - docker pull $CONTAINER_TEST_IMAGE
    - docker tag $CONTAINER_TEST_IMAGE $CONTAINER_RELEASE_IMAGE
    - docker push $CONTAINER_RELEASE_IMAGE

DEPLOY:
  image:
    # use kubectl image to have access to kubectl command
    name: bitnami/kubectl:latest
    entrypoint: [""]
  stage: deploy
  # needs: ["build", "release"]
  # Optional: Manual gate
  when: manual
  script:
    # add env variable to inject postgres url with password
    - export database_url=postgres://postgres:$MASTER_PWD@postgres-service:5432/django_db
    - echo " $CI_PROJECT_NAME-" >> zz_kustomize/kustomization.yaml
    # apply and rollout new update
    - kubectl apply -k zz_kustomize
    - kubectl rollout restart deploy/$CI_PROJECT_NAME-otreedemo

RESET-DB-OTREE:
  image:
    name: bitnami/kubectl:latest
    entrypoint: [""]
  stage: deploy
  # needs: ["build", "release"]
  # Optional: Manual gate
  when: manual
  script:
    # exec into otree pod and run resetdb command from script
    - kubectl exec deploy/$CI_PROJECT_NAME-otreedemo -- bash .resetdb.sh

DELETE-DEPLOYMENT:
  image:
    name: bitnami/kubectl:latest
    entrypoint: [""]
  stage: deploy
  # Optional: Manual gate
  when: manual
  script:
    # create same environment as deployment
    - export database_url=postgres://postgres:$MASTER_PWD@postgres-service:5432/django_db
    - echo " $CI_PROJECT_NAME-" >> zz_kustomize/kustomization.yaml
    # delete project by deleting kustomize
    - kubectl delete -k zz_kustomize
```

## What next?

Now wait for your pipeline to run. After it is done, you can view your project in the browser. Congratulations, this concludes the oForest set up. You now can easily deploy any experiments to your cluster.
